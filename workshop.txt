title=Easy Plates
description=At the moment, the game only allows placing certain foods like soups, stews, pasta, and rice into bowls.
description=Everything else has to be eaten directly from the container it was cooked in, rendering that item unusable until itâ€™s emptied.
description=This mod effectively solves the problem, allowing you to use plates to store all the other recipes, so you can keep cookin'.
description=It seamlessly supports all plate colors, adding models and animations for each of them.
description=The mod also changes the base colored plate sprites so they are actually colored, and no longer only white.
description=
description=When splitting, the mod retrieves every single food property and applies it to the resulting plate, dividing it as necessary.
description=For example, any poison added gets split into each plate evenly.
description=Instead, the heat of the item is not split, so all plates will have the same heat as the starting item.
description=
description=What you can currently split into plates:
description=- Whole Pie/Cake
description=- Stir Fry
description=- Roast
description=- Omelette (in the Frying Pan)

description=Current supported languages are English and Italian.
