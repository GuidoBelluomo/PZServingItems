This mod makes vanilla plates useful, letting you use them to store food.

At the moment, the game only allows placing select items like soup, stew, pasta, and rice into bowls. Anything else must be eaten directly off the item it is cooked in, rendering that item useless until emptied out.
This mod effectively solves that, allowing all of those other recipes to be placed in plates so they can let you cook.

This mod effectively retrieves every single food property and applies it to the resulting plate, dividing it as necessary.

What you can currently split into plates:
- Whole Pie/Cake
- Stir Fry
- Roast
- Omelette (in the Frying Pan)

Current supported languages are English and Italian.
