At the moment, the game only allows placing certain foods like soups, stews, pasta, and rice into bowls.
Everything else has to be eaten directly from the container it was cooked in, rendering that item unusable until itâ€™s emptied.
This mod effectively solves the problem, allowing you to use plates to store all the other recipes, so you can keep cookin'.
It seamlessly supports all plate colors, adding models and animations for each of them.
The mod also changes the base colored plate sprites so they are actually colored, and no longer only white.

When splitting, the mod retrieves every single food property and applies it to the resulting plate, dividing it as necessary.

What you can currently split into plates:
- Whole Pie/Cake
- Stir Fry
- Roast
- Omelette (in the Frying Pan)

Current supported languages are English and Italian.
